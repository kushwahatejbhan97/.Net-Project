<p><strong>Feeling frustrated with&nbsp;your job search?</strong></p>
<p>Most of our clients are new to career coaching and wonder, &ldquo;what is career coaching?&rdquo; and &ldquo;how can a career coach help me?&rdquo; You may be wondering the same thing. So, let&rsquo;s look at what career coaching is and why it helps so many people. To address these questions, consider the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you feel about your career?</li>
<li>Do you love going to work?</li>
<li>Do you feel you&rsquo;ve reached your full potential?</li>
<li>Are you appropriately compensated for the job you do?</li>
<li>Do you feel there is something better for you out there?</li>
<li>Is your career in alignment with your values?</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on your answers to the questions above, could your career be more rewarding? Could you be more confident about your future? If you said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; then a career coach can help you.</p>
<h2>What is Career Coaching?</h2>
<p>A more formal definition of career coaching from the International Federation of Coaching (ICF) states that a career coach partners with you in a thought-provoking and creative process that inspires you to maximize your personal and professional potential.Standing on this foundation, the coach&rsquo;s responsibility is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discover, clarify, and align with what you want to achieve.</li>
<li>Encourage self-discovery.</li>
<li>Elicit solutions and strategies.</li>
<li>Hold you responsible and accountable.</li>
</ul>
<p>This process helps clients dramatically improve their outlook on work and life, while improving their leadership skills and unlocking their potential.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s competitive jobs market, you&rsquo;re facing some challenges in securing a new position&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Effectively communicating what you have to offer.</li>
<li>Extending your professional network and developing strong relationships with key players.</li>
<li>Crafting a compelling CV / Resume that gets you the job interviews you want.</li>
<li>Developing strategies to perform at your best and succeed in those job interviews.</li>
